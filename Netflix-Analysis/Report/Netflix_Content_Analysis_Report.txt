## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Netflix's content catalog using data analytics techniques. 
We used a combination of Python, MySQL, and Power BI to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about the type, origin, and distribution of content available on Netflix.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas):** For data cleaning and transformation
- **MySQL:** For structured data analysis using SQL queries
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Removed duplicate records
2. Converted `date_added` to datetime format
3. Extracted `duration_int` and `duration_unit` from the `duration` column
4. Checked for and handled missing values
5. Renamed/reorganized columns for clarity
